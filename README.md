## Version 1.0
Finally started creating my own website! Looks pretty bare bones right now, but it's on its way!

This release features only HTML and CSS elements; there is no Javascript (yet)! I wanted to get the blocking of the website done first before I jumped into the fun stuff.

I also intend to upload pictures to make the website more personal. The problem is, I don't have any good ones to upload (yet!)! Hopefully this can be done in the next update as well.
